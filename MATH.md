# LLM Index Analyzer: Mathematical Foundations

## Mathematical Sophistication Overview

This system implements rigorous mathematical algorithms from graph theory, network analysis, information theory, and computational complexity theory to provide the most accurate and sophisticated code analysis available.

## Core Mathematical Components

### 1. Graph Theory Foundation

#### Adjacency Matrix Representation
```
A(i,j) = {
  1 if there exists a dependency from node i to node j
  0 otherwise
}
```

#### Centrality Measures

**Betweenness Centrality**
```
CB(v) = Σ(s≠v≠t) [σst(v) / σst]
```
Where σst is the number of shortest paths from s to t, and σst(v) is the number of those paths passing through v.

**Eigenvector Centrality**
```
CE(v) = (1/λ) Σ(u∈N(v)) CE(u)
```
Where λ is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix.

**PageRank**
```
PR(v) = (1-d)/N + d Σ(u∈In(v)) [PR(u) / |Out(u)|]
```
Where d is the damping factor (0.85), N is the number of nodes.

**Closeness Centrality**
```
CC(v) = (n-1) / Σ(u≠v) d(v,u)
```
Where d(v,u) is the shortest path distance between v and u.

### 2. Clustering Algorithms

#### Louvain Algorithm (Modularity Optimization)
```
ΔQ = [Σin + 2ki,in] / 2m - [(Σtot + ki) / 2m]² - [Σin / 2m] - [Σtot / 2m]² - [ki / 2m]²
```
Where:
- Σin = sum of weights of links inside community
- Σtot = sum of weights of links incident to community
- ki = sum of weights of links incident to node i
- m = sum of all link weights in the network

#### Spectral Clustering
Uses the Fiedler vector (second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix):
```
L = D - A
```
Where D is the degree matrix and A is the adjacency matrix.

#### Modularity Calculation
```
Q = (1/2m) Σij [Aij - (kikj/2m)] δ(ci, cj)
```
Where δ(ci, cj) = 1 if nodes i and j are in the same community, 0 otherwise.

### 3. Complexity Metrics

#### Cyclomatic Complexity
```
V(G) = E - N + 2P
```
Where E = edges, N = nodes, P = connected components.

#### Cognitive Complexity
```
CC = Σ(complexity_increment × nesting_level)
```

#### Halstead Metrics
```
Vocabulary: n = n1 + n2
Length: N = N1 + N2
Volume: V = N × log₂(n)
Difficulty: D = (n1/2) × (N2/n2)
Effort: E = D × V
```

#### Maintainability Index
```
MI = 171 - 5.2 × ln(HV) - 0.23 × CC - 16.2 × ln(LOC)
```
Where HV = Halstead Volume, CC = Cyclomatic Complexity, LOC = Lines of Code.

### 4. Network Topology Analysis

#### Clustering Coefficient
```
Ci = 2ei / [ki(ki-1)]
```
Where ei is the number of links between neighbors of node i, ki is the degree of node i.

**Global Clustering Coefficient:**
```
C = (1/n) Σi Ci
```

#### Average Path Length
```
L = (1/n(n-1)) Σi≠j d(i,j)
```

#### Small-World Coefficient
```
σ = (C/Crand) / (L/Lrand)
```
Where Crand and Lrand are clustering coefficient and path length of random network.

#### Scale-Free Parameter (Power Law Exponent)
```
P(k) ~ k^(-γ)
```
Estimated using maximum likelihood estimation on degree distribution.

### 5. Quality Assessment Metrics

#### Silhouette Score
```
s(i) = (b(i) - a(i)) / max(a(i), b(i))
```
Where a(i) is mean intra-cluster distance, b(i) is mean nearest-cluster distance.

#### Conductance
```
φ(S) = |E(S, S̄)| / min(vol(S), vol(S̄))
```
Where E(S, S̄) are edges crossing the cut, vol(S) is the volume of set S.

#### Cohesion and Coupling
```
Cohesion = |internal_edges| / |possible_internal_edges|
Coupling = |external_edges| / |total_edges|
```

### 6. Advanced Graph Properties

#### Network Robustness
```
R = 1 - (Σtop10% centrality) / (Σall centrality)
```

#### Efficiency
```
E = (1/n(n-1)) Σi≠j (1/d(i,j))
```

#### Density
```
ρ = 2m / [n(n-1)]
```
Where m = number of edges, n = number of nodes.
